# @TEST-DOC: Test Zeek parsing a trace file made with bulk-created SET commands

# @TEST-EXEC: zeek -Cr ${TRACES}/bulk-loading.pcap ${PACKAGE} %INPUT >output
# @TEST-EXEC: btest-diff output

# The bulk-loading functionality just sends the serialized form from some ruby
# code directly to the server, but it's useful to see if that trace might come
# up with something different. See:
